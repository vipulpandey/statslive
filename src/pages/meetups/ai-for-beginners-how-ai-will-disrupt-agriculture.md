    presentationTitle: 'AI for Beginners : How AI will disrupt Agriculture ?'
    text: >-
      According to UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the population will
      increase by 2 billion by 2050. However, only 4% additional land will come
      under cultivation by then. In this context, use of latest technological
      solutions to make farming more efficient, remains one of the greatest
      imperatives. While Artificial Intelligence (AI) sees a lot of direct
      application across sectors, it can also bring a paradigm shift in how we
      see farming today. AI-powered solutions will not only enable farmers to do
      more with less, it will also improve quality and ensure faster
      go-to-market for crops. In this session, we will discuss how AI can change
      the agriculture landscape, the application of drone-based image processing
      techniques, precision farming landscape, the future of agriculture and the
      challenges ahead.
